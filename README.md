# Eurorack Resources
This is a repository to contain all the resources and links I use for designing Eurorack modules.
There will be things in this repository that are subjective, for example footprints or suppliers that I prefer. Feel free to submit a pull request if there is anything you think is *wrong* or anything you would like to add to the collection.
  
Everything in this repository is entirely copyleft, you are free to reproduce anything you find here for all uses, including commercial, as long as you also share them with a copyleft license.
