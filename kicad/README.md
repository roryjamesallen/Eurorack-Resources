# KiCad

These files are for KiCad 6.0, they may or may not work with previous versions.
The module template uses diode and capacitor footprints included with KiCad, however it uses my custom Eurorack power header footprint (this is because I think it's essential to have a red stripe marking on the silkscreen). You can either install my footprint into your KiCad library, or just use the built in KiCad footprint named "Connector_IDC:IDC-Header_2x05_P2.54mm_Vertical" and *make sure* you add your own marking for the red stripe orientation, which should be on the -12V side, 90 degrees clockwise from the key in the shroud when the footprint is on the front silkscreen layer
